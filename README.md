# QRokBox Generator

This is a simple desktop application to generate rokbox (take a look at chapter links) html output for albums 
and resize the images to prefered sizes. Why do we implemnt not just a joomla web plugin? Because the desktop 
application is faster and I like Qt framework with C++. I am a native embedded developer so I prefer this 
solution. In the feature maybe I implement a joomla web plugin for this.
